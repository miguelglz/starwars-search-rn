# React Native app ⚛️ - Starwars info search
## A React Native app, with basic navigation, that fetches and shows results from a [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

### How to run this project 📱
- `yarn install`
- `cd ios && pod install`
- run it from Xcode `open ios/swapiSearch.xcworkspace`
- if the app doesn't find the custom fonts try `react-native link` or `npx react-native link` depending on your configuration.

### TODO 👨‍💻
- Unit tests
- Animations
- Loading placeholders
- Test and adjust in other screens other than iPhone SE
- Add custom font support to android
- Fix uppercase and symbols in android
